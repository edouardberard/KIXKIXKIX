      This tool was made by Edouard Berard as part of a project conducted at the Glasgow School of Art, BA InteractionDesign. <br> 
      It uses P5.js, ML5.js and the PoseNet machine learning model, the code was taken from The Coding Train by Daniel Schiffman. <br> 
      This project explores the limit of computer vision to generate a font from your posture. The stiffer you are the
      sharper the font will be. <br>
      For best results please stand about 2 meters from your webcam, from head to toe. 
      <br><br>
      The variable font is open-source and can be downloaded <u><a href="https://1998edo.shortcm.li/KIXVAR"><u>here.</u></a>
